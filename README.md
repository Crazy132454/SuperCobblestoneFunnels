# SuperCobblestoneFunnels
Making skyblocks less grindy for fabric 1.17

this version uses a new system of tiers and rarities where an ore is defined in ores.acfg:
`"minecraft:iron_ore,1,1",`
formatted block,tier,rarity

a tier is defined per funnel, a cobblestone funnel is tier 1 etc
rarity is defined as "the higher the number, the rarer something is"

I do have to add some other fixes, but non vanilla funnels dont have recipes, this is intended for modpack devs to do (would anyone really use this mod on its own?)
